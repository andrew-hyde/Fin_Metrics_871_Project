```{r}

rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.

list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))

# How to get started
```{r, eval=F, echo=T} 
# eval=F and echo=T, as i want to see the code but I don't want it to run again
# create a Texevier project

Texevier::create_template(
    directory = "C:/Masters Economics/Fin Metrics/Fin_Metrics_Project",
            template_name = "Fin_Metrics_Project", build_project = TRUE, open_project = FALSE)

```


# Question 1:

```{r}
# read in the data
library(tidyverse)
data_alsi <- read_rds("data/Alsi_Returns.rds")

# determine which sectors are included in the data set
data_alsi %>% select(Sector) %>% 
    unique()

```
